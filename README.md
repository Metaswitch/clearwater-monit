SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

__Memory and Disk space__. A minimum of 1 megabytes RAM are required and around 500KB of free disk space. You may need more RAM depending on how many services Monit should monitor. 
  
__ANSI-C Compiler and Build System__. You will need an ANSI-C99 compiler installed to build Monit. The GNU C compiler (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended. In addition, your PATH must contain basic build tools such as make.

GIT
===

To checkout Monit source code, use `git clone git@bitbucket.org:tildeslash/monit.git`.


BOOTSTRAPPING
=============

If you build Monit from the git repository you should call `./bootstrap` first, before continuing with the installation steps below. 


INSTALLATION
============

Monit utilize the GNU auto-tools and provided the requirements above are
satisfied, building Monit is conducted via the standard;  

> ./configure  
> make  
> make install  

This will install Monit and the Monit man-file in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1 respectively. If you want another location than
/usr/local, run configure with the *--prefix* options and specify the install directory. 

Use ./configure --help for build and install options. By default, Monit is built with SSL, PAM and large file support. You can change this
with the *--without-<xxx>* options to ./configure. For instance, *--without-ssl*, *--without-pam* or *--without-largefiles*.

DISTRIBUTION
============

If you need to build your own Monit source release package, follow these steps.

> make cleanall  
> ./bootstrap && ./configure  
> make dist 

This will produce a `monit-x.y.tar.gz` file in the current directory which can be used for distribution. Note that we do not use *make distclean* which is the convention, instead we use `make cleanall` to reset the Monit build directory, including libmonit, to pristine condition for a source release. Before a release you might also want to run *unit-tests* in *libmonit*. I.e. *cd libmonit; make verify;*. 

QUICK START
===========

After you have built Monit you can simply start the monit program from the build directory to test it. Monit will use the `monitrc` control file
located in this directory for it's configuration. The file is setup to start Monit's http server so you have something interesting to look at;
After you have started monit, point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2812/` and log in with the username `admin` and password `monit`.

Once started, monit will run as a background process. To stop monit, use `monit quit`. To run monit in the foreground and in diagnostic mode,
start monit with the -Iv options. In diagnostic mode, monit will print debug information to the console. Use `ctrl+c` to stop monit in
diagnostic mode. To see all options for the program, use `monit -h`.

Copy `monitrc` in the build directory to *~/.monitrc* or if you plan to run Monit as root, to */etc/monitc*. Use this file as a starting
point to write your own configuration file for Monit.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Please use `man monit` for an in-depth documentation of the program. More documentation can be found at [Monit's web-site](http://mmonit.com/monit/ "Documentation")
